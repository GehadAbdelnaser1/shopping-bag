# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

###### ##### ###############
##### Gehad docs
### NavBar 
The code represents a React functional component called "Nav" that renders a navigation bar with various icons, links, and dropdown menus. Here's a brief documentation for each part of the code:

### Import statements:

The first few lines of the code import various React components and icons used in the navigation bar. Specifically, the following components and icons are imported:

- `React` is the core React library.
- `Component` is a React class that is used to define components.
- `RiArrowDownSFill` is an icon from the React Icons library that represents a downward-pointing arrow.
- `FaListUl` is an icon from the React Icons library that represents a list.
- `FaRegHeart` is an icon from the React Icons library that represents a heart.
- `FaShoppingBag` is an icon from the React Icons library that represents a shopping bag.
- `FaSistrix` is an icon from the React Icons library that represents a search icon.
- `FaWindowClose` is an icon from the React Icons library that represents a window close button.

The last few lines of the code import two CSS files and a JavaScript file related to the navigation bar. Specifically, the following files are imported:

- `./nav.css` is a CSS file that contains styling for the navigation bar.
- `./nav.js` is a JavaScript file that contains functions related to the navigation bar, specifically the `hideMenu` and `showMenu` functions.

### The Nav component:

The `Nav` component is defined as a functional component that returns JSX code. The JSX code represents the entire navigation bar, which is divided into three main sections:

1. The top section:
   - The top section contains two dropdown menus for selecting currency and language.
   - The dropdown menus are represented by `ul` elements with `li` elements inside them.
   - The `RiArrowDownSFill` icon is used to represent the dropdown arrow.
   - The entire top section is contained within a `nav` element with a class of `one`.
   - The `nav-links` and `fa` elements are used to show/hide the dropdown menu in mobile view.
2. The middle section:
   - The middle section contains the logo and search bar.
   - The logo and search bar are contained within a `div` element with a class of `logo`.
   - The logo is represented by a `div` element with a class of `shopping`.
   - The search bar is represented by an `input` element with a class of `searchInp` and a `button` element with a class of `searchBtn`.
   - The `FaSistrix`, `FaRegHeart`, and `FaShoppingBag` icons are used to represent the search, wishlist, and shopping bag respectively.
3. The bottom section:
   - The bottom section contains the main navigation links.
   - The navigation links are represented by a `ul` element with `li` elements inside them.
   - The entire bottom section is contained within a `nav` element with a class of `tow`.

### Export statement:

Finally, the `Nav` component is exported as the default export of the module, allowing other parts of the application to import and use it.

### Nav.css
This is a CSS code that defines the styles for a navigation bar. Here's a brief documentation for each part of the code:

- `nav`: styles the navigation bar element with a width of 100%, a height of 80px, a background color of #0e334f, and text color of #fff.
- `.small p`: defines the text of a paragraph element with a display of inline.
- `.one`: styles the top section of the navigation bar with a width of 100%, a height of 80px, a background color of #0e334f, and text color of #fff. It also uses flexbox to align the items horizontally with space between them.
- `nav ul li`: styles the list items of the navigation bar with no text decoration, no bullet points, and an inline block display. Also, it gives them some padding.
- `nav ul li i`: styles the icon elements inside the navigation bar list items with a color of #fff and a top padding of 0.6em.
- `a`: styles the link elements with no text decoration and a color of #fff.
- `.icon`: styles the icon container with a display of flex and a gap of 13px between items.
- `.logo`: styles the logo container with a font size of 1.3rem, a background color of #0e334f, and a text color of #fff. Also, it uses flexbox to align the items horizontally with space around them.
- `.logo P`: styles the paragraph element inside the logo container with a display of inline.
- `.logo span`: styles the span element inside the logo container with a color of #ffc107.
- `.logo input`: styles the search input element inside the logo container with a width of 43em, a height of 27px, a border-radius of 20px, a border of 2px solid #fff, and a background color of #0e334f.
- `.logo button`: styles the search button element inside the logo container with a width of 35px, a height of 30px, a border-radius of 20px, a border of 2px solid #fff, a background color of #0e334f, a text color of #fff, a font size of 1rem, and a font weight of 600.
- `.tow`: styles the bottom section of the navigation bar with a width of 100%, a height of 80px, a background color of #0e334f, and text color of #fff. It also uses flexbox to align the items horizontally with space between them.
- `hr`: styles the horizontal line element with a width of 80%, a height of 2px, a background color of #a39898, and no border.
- `.nav-links`: styles the navigation links container with a flex value of 1 and text align of right.
- `.nav-links ul li`: styles the list items inside the navigation links container with no bullet points, an inline block display, and some padding. It also sets their position to relative.
- `.nav-links ul li a`: styles the links inside the navigation links container with a color of #fff and no text decoration.
- `nav .fa`: styles the font awesome icons inside the navigation bar with a display of none.
- `@media (max-width: 800px)`: applies the following styles when the maximum screen width is 800px or lower. In this case, it reduces the width of the search input element to 20em.
- `@media (max-width: 600px)`: applies the following styles when the maximum screen width is 600px or lower. In this case, it changes the display of the navigation links container to fixed, makes it cover the entire height of the screen, and moves it to the right by 200px. It also displays the font awesome icons and changes the padding of the navigation links container. Additionally, it reduces the font size of the top section of the navigation bar and the bottom section of the navigation bar.
- `@media (max-width: 400px)`: applies the following styles when the maximum screen width is 400px or lower. In this case, it reduces the font size of the logo container, changes the margin of the icon container, reduces the width of the search input and button elements, and reduces the font size of the top and bottom sections of the navigation bar.

### Nav.js
This is a JavaScript code that defines two functions that can be used to show and hide a navigation menu on a website. Here's a brief documentation for each part of the code:

- `export const showMenu = () => { }`: defines a function named `showMenu` that can be exported from this file to be used by other parts of the code. This function selects the element with the id "navLinks" and sets its `right` CSS property to 0, which means it moves the element to the right by 0 pixels. This effectively shows the navigation menu on the page.
- `export const hideMenu = () => { }`: defines a function named `hideMenu` that can be exported from this file to be used by other parts of the code. This function selects the element with the id "navLinks" and sets its `right` CSS property to -200px, which means it moves the element to the right by 200 pixels. This effectively hides the navigation menu from the page.

Both functions use `document.getElementById("navLinks")` to select the HTML element with the id "navLinks". This assumes that there is an HTML element on the page with this id, which is presumably the navigation menu that is being shown or hidden. These functions can be called from other parts of the code, for example, in response to a user clicking a button or tapping a menu icon on a mobile device.

### ProductList.jsx --ProductList2.jsx
  This is a React component named `ProductList` that renders a list of products with their prices and ratings. 

The first few lines import the necessary modules and image files that are used in the component. 

```
import React, { Component } from "react";
import frst from "./images/last.jpg";
import scend from "./images/sofa1.jpg";
import third from "./images/sofa10.jpeg";
import forth from "./images/sofa9.jpeg";
import "./ProductList.css";
import { FaStar ,FaStarHalfAlt } from "react-icons/fa";
```

The `ProductList` component is a functional component that returns a JSX element. It contains a section with a class name of `ProductList` that displays the product list. The product list is made up of four `card` elements that contain an image, title, description, rating, price, and discounted price.

```
const ProductList = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <section className="ProductList">
        <p className="p">NEW PRODUCTS DEALS </p>
        <div className="line"></div>
        <div className="main">
          <div className="card">
            ...
          </div>
          <div className="card" id="scend">
            ...
          </div>
          <div className="card">
            ...
          </div>
          <div className="card">
            ...
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Each `card` element contains an image of the product, a title, a description, a rating, a price, and a discounted price. The image is displayed using the `img` tag with a `src` attribute that is set to the image file imported at the beginning of the file. The title and description are displayed using `h3` and `p` tags, respectively. The rating is displayed using the `FaStar` and `FaStarHalfAlt` components from the `react-icons/fa` module. The `icons` class is used to style the rating. The price and discounted price are displayed using `h5` and `span` tags, respectively.

```
<div className="card">
  <div className="img">
    <img src={frst} alt="" />
  </div>
  <h3>squab bench</h3>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
  <div className="icons">
    <FaStar />
    <FaStar />
    <FaStar />
    <FaStar />
    <FaStar />
  </div>
  <h5>$420.00</h5>
  <span>$550.00</span>
</div>
```

The second `card` element has an additional `id` attribute of `"scend"` and is used to style the card differently from the other cards.

Finally, the `export default ProductList;` statement at the end of the file exports the `ProductList` component so that it can be used in other parts of the application.



#### ProductList.css

This is a CSS stylesheet that styles the `ProductList` component.

## index.js
This is an entry point file for a React application that renders several components in the `root` element of the HTML document. 

```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import Nav from "./containers/nav.jsx";
import Header from "./containers/header.jsx";
import ProductList from "./containers/ProductList.jsx";
import ProductList2 from "./containers/ProductList2.jsx";
```

The first few lines import the necessary modules and components that are used in the application. The `Nav`, `Header`, `ProductList`, and `ProductList2` components are imported from their respective files in the `containers` directory.

```
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Nav />
    <Header />
    <ProductList />
    <ProductList2 />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

The `createRoot` method from the `ReactDOM` module is used to create a root for the application. The `render` method is then called on the `root` element with a JSX expression that renders the imported components in the `root` element. The `React.StrictMode` component is used to wrap the components, which enables certain development mode checks and warnings to help identify potential issues in the application.

Overall, this file sets up the basic structure of the React application and renders the initial components.
